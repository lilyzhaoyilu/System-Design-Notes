# Chapter1 Reliability, Scalability, and Maintainability

## **Reliability**

Definition: system should continue to work correctly

Faults: one component of the system deviating from its spec

Failure: system as whole stops providing the required service

Fault-tolerant/Resilient: system that anticipate faults and can cope with them

We prefer tolerating faults over prenting faults. 

## Scalability

system can be easily upgraded

## Maintainability: should be able to maintain
